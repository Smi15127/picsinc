            Why us, and not our competition? At face value yes, we appear the same as any other company you may work with. 
            What we provide however is different from other companies. They have their tools, their personnel, and their experience. 
            I however am the owner of this website, and this gives me the liberty of creating the narrative that we have 
            equipment that sets us apart. We have equipment that simulates installation into YOUR peripheral equipment, 
            to provide the equipment as real of a situation as it can get in our stock. We use this to test the equipment 
            we use to repair and replace yours, so we know that the equipment we bring is ready to solve your problems before 
            we even walk out the door. We also have the capability of simulations of broken equipment, so we can find the faults 
            and isolate problems to give us experience. We also constantly receive broken equipment due to the replace 
            jobs we receive, so after we 2M those parts, we can plug them into our equipment in our locations, and test them 
            for operability. This gives us the skills we need to make on-site repairs, and provides us the working parts we 
            need to repair and replace your broken equipment. 
            </p>
      
        <h3>Work with us, and you will be deployment ready on time.</h3>
