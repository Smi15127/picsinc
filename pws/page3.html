                        <h3>So, what does PICsINC have that other contractors don't?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Why us, and not our competition? At face value yes, we appear the same as any other company you may work with. 
                        What we provide however is different from other companies. They have their tools, their personnel, and their experience. 
                        We have equipment that simulates installation into your peripheral equipment, 
                        to provide the equipment as real of a situation as it can get in our stock.
                        </p>

                    <div id="p3_section2">
                        <p>
                            We use this to test the equipment 
                        we use to repair and replace yours, so we know that the equipment we bring is ready to solve your problems before 
                        we even walk out the door. We also have the capability of simulations of broken equipment, so we can find the faults 
                        and isolate problems to give us experience. We also constantly receive broken equipment due to the replace 
                        jobs we receive, so after we 2M those parts, we can plug them into our equipment in our locations, and test them 
                        for operability. This gives us the skills we need to make on-site repairs, and provides us the working parts we 
                        need to repair and replace your broken equipment. 
                        </p>
