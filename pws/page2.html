<h3>What information do we need from you?</h3>
<p>
In order to request our services, a little bit of information is required so we know how to help you, 
and who to talk to so we know what your issue is, or can ask to have the problem clarified. You will need to 
provide your name, rank is optional, you need to provide your ship hull number, 
what base you’re stationed at (and moored), a description of what your issue is, where in the ship your issue is, 
and what the symptoms of the problem are. Once we have all this information, we will know what and where the problem is, 
where and how we can contact you for questions of clarification, and we’ll be able to handle the rest.

            With every one of us here at PICsINC having prior naval experience, we understand how vital it is to 
            get the wet stuff on the hot stuff as soon as possible, and so we specialize in repairing all equipment
            that will be instrumental in getting knowledge of the fire to you as soon as possible, and the equipment
            that will facilitate the communications required to get you to the fire as soon as possible. You've got a ship
            to save, after all.
