      <h3>Why My site?</h3>
      <p>
        
The services I provide are simple, I have a lot of prior experience with navy equipment in an 
Arleigh Burke class destroyer as an IC, and I can provide those skills to the navy as a private contractor. 
This website assumes I have the personnel and resources available to be able to provide these services, in replacing 
and fixing broken equipment that the service members do not have access to. I have reliable parts that will work 
upon receipt so don’t worry about receiving bad parts as is so common when ordering through supply. 
My purpose is not to replace supply, just to have the materials on-hand when called in for a job, so that 
if the part is the problem, I can replace it and fix the problem.

      <h3>	What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</h3>
      
        
      <p>
Getting started is easy. Request our services on the website and fill out the required information to let us find you, 
and know what the issue is. We’ll come with the rest, and you’ll find yourself with one less problem to worry about 
in your preparations for deployment.
</p>
<h3>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</h3>
<p>
In order to request our services, a little bit of information is required so we know how to help you, 
and who to talk to so we know what your issue is, or can ask to have the problem clarified. You will need to 
provide your name, rank is optional, you need to provide your ship hull number, 
what base you’re stationed at (and moored), a description of what your issue is, where in the ship your issue is, 
and what the symptoms of the problem are. Once we have all this information, we will know what and where the problem is, 
where and how we can contact you for questions of clarification, and we’ll be able to handle the rest.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <h3>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</h3>
      <p>
Why us, and not our competition? At face value yes, we appear the same as any other company you may work with. 
What we provide however is different from other companies. They have their tools, their personnel, and their experience. 
I however am the owner of this website, and this gives me the liberty of creating the narrative that we have 
equipment that sets us apart. We have equipment that simulates installation into YOUR peripheral equipment, 
to provide the equipment as real of a situation as it can get in our stock. We use this to test the equipment 
we use to repair and replace yours, so we know that the equipment we bring is ready to solve your problems before 
we even walk out the door. We also have the capability of simulations of broken equipment, so we can find the faults 
and isolate problems to give us experience. We also constantly receive broken equipment due to the replace 
jobs we receive, so after we 2M those parts, we can plug them into our equipment in our locations, and test them 
for operability. This gives us the skills we need to make on-site repairs, and provides us the working parts we 
need to repair and replace your broken equipment. 

<h3>Work with us, and you will be deployment ready on time.</h3>

        used last week just paywalled me. The only thing that seemed to go well was the header and footer. 
        The word document seems crammed, but when the text is inserted into the webpage, I will have a 
        lot more freedom and room to make the images and the text relative to one another far more visually appealing.]
