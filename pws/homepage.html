                <h3>Prior ICs INC. Cheesy? Yes. Shows who we are and what we're made of? Also yes.</h3>
                <h1>Who are we?</h1>
                <p>
                    Well, let us tell you. The services we provide are simple, we have a lot of prior experience with naval equipment on 
                    Arleigh Burke class destroyers as ICs, and we can provide these skills to the navy as private contractors. 
                    This website shall assume we have the personnel and resources available to be able to provide these services, in replacing 
                    and fixing broken equipment that the service members do not have access to. We have reliable parts that will work 
                    upon receipt so donâ€™t worry about receiving bad parts - as is so common when ordering through supply. 
                    Our purpose is not to replace supply, just to have the materials on-hand when called in for a job, so that 
                    if the part is the problem, we can replace it. 
                </p>

                        With every one of us here at PICsINC having prior naval experience, we understand how vital it is to 
                        get the wet stuff on the hot stuff as soon as possible, and so we specialize in repairing all equipment
                        that will be instrumental in getting knowledge of the fire to you as soon as possible, and the equipment
                        that will facilitate the communications required to get you to the fire as soon as possible. You've got a ship
                        to save, after all.
