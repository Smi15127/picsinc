            <h3>Why contract with PICsINC?</h3>
            <p>
                The services I provide are simple, I have a lot of prior experience with navy equipment in an 
                Arleigh Burke class destroyer as an IC, and I can provide those skills to the navy as a private contractor. 
                This website assumes I have the personnel and resources available to be able to provide these services, in replacing 
                and fixing broken equipment that the service members do not have access to. I have reliable parts that will work 
                upon receipt so donâ€™t worry about receiving bad parts as is so common when ordering through supply. 
                My purpose is not to replace supply, just to have the materials on-hand when called in for a job, so that 
                if the part is the problem, I can replace it and fix the problem. 
            </p>
